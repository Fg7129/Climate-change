        <p><b>Climate change:</b>Refers to significant and lasting changes in the Earth's climate patterns, particularly an increase in average global temperatures over an extended period. While climate naturally fluctuates over time, the term climate change is often used to describe the current warming trend caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, and industrial processes, which increase the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Here are some key points about climate change:</p>
       <p>The average temperature of the Earth’s surface is now about 1.2°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.</p>
        <p>Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.</p>
       <p>The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.</p>

        <h2>Key Drivers of Climate Change:</h2>

        <ol>
        Greenhouse Gas Emissions:
            <ul>Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases contributing to climate change. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, causing the Earth’s temperature to rise. The burning of fossil fuels for energy, transportation, and industrial processes is the largest source of CO2 emissions.</ul>
        </ol>

        <ol>
        Deforestation:
            <ul>Trees absorb CO2, so when forests are cut down or burned, the carbon stored in those trees is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Additionally, deforestation reduces the planet’s ability to absorb CO2.</ul>
        </ol>

        <ol>
        Agriculture:
            <ul>Agricultural practices, especially livestock farming (which produces methane), and the use of fertilizers (which release nitrous oxide), also contribute significantly to climate change.</ul>
        </ol>

        <ol>
        Industrial Processes:
            <ul>Certain industrial processes, such as cement production and the use of refrigerants, release potent greenhouse gases that contribute to warming.</ul>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="im">
        <h2>Impacts of Climate Change:</h2>

        <ol>
        Rising Temperatures:
            <ul>Average global temperatures have increased by about 1°C (1.8°F) since the late 19th century, with the most rapid warming occurring in recent decades. This warming has profound effects on ecosystems, weather patterns, and sea levels.</ul>
        </ol>

        <ol>
        Extreme Weather Events:
            <ul>Increased temperatures can cause more frequent and severe heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and storms. These extreme weather events can lead to flooding, droughts, and wildfires, all of which disrupt ecosystems and human communities.</ul>
        </ol>
        
        <ol>
        Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels:   
            <ul>Warming temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising sea levels. Rising seas threaten coastal communities and ecosystems and can lead to more frequent flooding.</ul>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            Ocean Acidification:
            <ul>Higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere also result in higher levels of CO2 being absorbed by oceans, making them more acidic. This harms marine life, especially coral reefs, shellfish, and other organisms that rely on calcium carbonate to form shells and skeletons.</ul>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            Biodiversity Loss:
            <ul>As ecosystems change due to altered temperatures and weather patterns, many species are at risk of extinction. Shifts in habitats, food availability, and migration patterns contribute to biodiversity loss.</ul>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            Food and Water Security:
            <ul>Changes in precipitation patterns, more frequent droughts, and extreme temperatures can disrupt agriculture, leading to food shortages and higher prices. Water resources may also become scarcer in some areas, exacerbating challenges for communities dependent on freshwater supplies.</ul>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            Health Risks:
            <ul>The rise in heatwaves, air pollution, and changing disease patterns can have significant public health impacts. For instance, warmer temperatures can expand the range of mosquitoes that carry diseases like malaria and dengue fever.</ul>
        </ol>

    <h2>Mitigation and Adaptation:</h2>
    <p><b>Mitigation:</b> Involves efforts to reduce or prevent the emission of greenhouse gases. This includes:</p>

        <ul>Transitioning to renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, etc.)</ul>

        <ul>Increasing energy efficiency in buildings and transportation</ul>

        <ul>Planting trees and reforesting areas</ul>

        <ul>Promoting sustainable agricultural practices</ul>

        <ul>Reducing waste and improving waste management</ul>

    <p><b>Adaptation:</b> Focuses on making adjustments to systems and practices in response to the impacts of climate change. This can include:</p>
    
        <ul>Building resilient infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events</ul>

        <ul>Developing drought-resistant crops</ul>

        <ul>Improving water conservation and management techniques</ul>

        <ul>Protecting coastal areas with barriers or planned relocations</ul>
    </div>

    <h1>Global Response:</h1>
    <p>International efforts to address climate change include agreements like the Paris Agreement (2015), which aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with an effort to limit it to 1.5°C. Countries around the world are encouraged to submit plans for reducing emissions and increasing climate resilience.</p>
    
    <h1>Role of Individuals:</h1>
    <p>While government policies and industry practices are critical, individuals can also contribute to fighting climate change by:</p>
        
        <ul>Reducing energy consumption</ul>

        <ul>Using public transportation or electric vehicles</ul>
        
        <ul>Supporting renewable energy initiatives</ul>

        <ul>Reducing waste, especially plastic</ul>

        <ul>Conserving water</ul>

        <ul>Supporting policies and leaders that prioritize climate action</ul>

    <h2>People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways</h2>
    <p>Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.</p>
    
    <h2>Every increase in global warming matters</h2>
    <p>In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 3.1°C of warming by the end of the century.

        The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Brazil) together accounted for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries accounted for only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
        
        Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.</p>
